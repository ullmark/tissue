# Tissue
Tissue is (supposed to be) an application I started coding while having some free time to
kill (on a train). It's supposed to be a super minimalistic wrapper around github
issues through the [Github Api v3][gapi]. The idea was to make the
application entirely client side. Except for one thing, the OAuth token, it uses
[SocketStream][] Pub/Sub.

Mostly it's about playing around with [Nodejs][node], [SocketStream][],
[Backbone][], [Docco][].

It's entirely styled using [Twitter Bootstrap][bootstrap], so
sorry those of you who are starting to get tired of that look.
